* fixed error when loading (import_data) example shapes: no empty cell allowed
  in attribute table (used to work when checking).
* bug fix in correct_compl_junctions(): if the cut outflow was also the inflow
  to another complex junction an error would occur like
  "Error in `[<-.data.table`(`*tmp*`, ii, jj, value = c(12013, 12019)) :  NA in j"
